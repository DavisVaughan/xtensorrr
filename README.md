# xtensorrr

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The goal of xtensorrr is to bundle all of the required headers of
`xtensor` and `xtl` into one package, along with the headers of
`xtensor-r`, so you can get started working with the headers right away,
without having to worry about the `cmake` setup that `xtensor` (for good
reason) uses.

This is not an attempt to replace `xtensor-r`, and I recommend that you
use that instead. This is just a way to easily play directly with the
headers.
